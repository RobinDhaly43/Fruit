Hello!

This is my first project and it's a simple one.

This program asks you what fruit you have(currently only 3 have been created), then tells you the price and asks you to input how much you have, then depending on how much you enter, gives you change, says "Thank you", or tells you how much you owe.

If you see any way to improve this(which there probably is a lot), please let me know! Thank you :)
